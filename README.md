# parampasta
A modding tool meant to be used in tandem with [Sparking Studio](https://mega.nz/file/OYM3TQrQ#Sq8_IoOpFI30vF4dDr0R0-JmpQbaseY0fQgsBGjiWxk), mainly inspired by its ``Full Swap`` feature in ``Utilities``. 

Made for my Italian friend [Bεzzo](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:4hh7ubpzmyq5raktz5sxc6ig)
to easily copy & paste parameters from one unpacked character costume to several others.
